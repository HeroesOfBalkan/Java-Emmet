# j-emmet README

Java Emmet (j-emmet) is an editor extension for productivity and time saving by introducing custom code generator that is typed directly into your editor. With a use of abbreviations given in this extension and order set as you wish, you will quickly complete your task! No more pain in finger and arm muscles!

> Note: This plugin is in early development stage. Some features and functinalities are missing.

## Features

Like HTML Emmet, j-emmet has a lot of features to keep things simplier.

### Abbreviations / Shortcuts

Extension j-emmet has a lot of abbreviations (shortcuts) to write for common usages like conditional statements, loops, declarations, error handling, etc.

j-emmet uses C-like syntax (or curly braces syntax) or something similar to that for abbreviations. To see all of abbreviations and how to use them, please check Documentation and Abbreviation list.

### Modularity and flexibility

Need to create a class? Write that 5-line boilerplate? Declare dozens of variables? Don't worry! This extension also supports copying same code multiple times. Not only that but copying whole block of the code! Instead of multiple else-if (nested conditionals) statements, write one else-if statement and repeat it with at least 2 characters from your keyboard.

There is much more than copying.

### Dynamic workflow and customatization

Everything is running and registered in runtime, whatever you write. What this extension also allows is to customize snippets and adapt to your needs. Working in Spring? Create your own user-defined snippets for your workspace and use them inside j-emmet formats.

---------------------------------

## Requirements

Nothing special is needed beside your preferred text editor* and knowledge. Go and write your next project.

> Note: Currently supported text editors and IDEs Visual Studio Code only, for now. You will wait for other text editors and IDEs to get similar one, since different softwares don't use similar APIs

## Working with Markdown (something for me)

**Note:** You can author your README using Visual Studio Code.  Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
